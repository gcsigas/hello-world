# hello-world
Doing another git tutorial to get to know it, I'll delete this later. Nothing to see here.

So I'm adding a few lines to this file to see how it works. I'm adding this to the readme-edits branch (I can't see where that is displayed except for in the address bar of the browser, doesn't seem too user friendly.)

I'll see if I can remove the next underlined line when merging (or what the process is called.)

[This is a line I DON'T want in my master branch.]

Well, if there's no underlined line above this and below the one which said I'd remove one, I succeeded. :D

End
