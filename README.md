# hello-world
Doing another GIT tutorial to get to know it, I'll delete this later. Nothing to see here.

So I'm adding a few lines to this file to see how it works. I'm adding this to the readme-edits branch (I can't see where that is displayed except for in the address bar of the browser, doesn't seem too user friendly.)

Adding a line on my desktop to a branch I created locally, seeing how this works, I guess?

Seeing how multiple saves show up on the desktop GIT app too. This paragraph I've added after a first save without a commit following that save. Well, let's see.

And if I add a line now, before trying to delete the branch which the system thinks got merged OK?

OK, I'll commit this then too. What?

End
